# Juzu C# SDK

- The `Client.cs` file provides a wrapper for Juzu API. You can import this file into your project and use it to setup the client and stream audio. You may also use it as reference to write your own class to integrate better with your project.

- To start using the SDK, you may either :

  - Clone this repo and copy over the necessary files (`../juzu.proto`, `Client.js`. `juzu.csprj`) to your project
  
  - Get the Juzu-SDK package from the packet manager Nuget :
  
  ```sh
    dotnet add package Juzu-SDK
  ```
